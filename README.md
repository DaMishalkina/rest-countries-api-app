### What I learned

I have tried SvelteKit routing and data fetching.

### Issues and modifications

- I have run into difficulties with rest countries api, building my sveltekit app, that's why I have gotten data from my git repository. However, there is luck of some data, foe example, no borders for the Czech Republic.

- Moreover, I have decided to use value of 1200px as min-width for desktop version.
